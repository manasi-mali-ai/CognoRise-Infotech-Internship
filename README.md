# Iris Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is commonly used for machine learning classification tasks.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species label for each sample.

### Features
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

### Target Variable
- Species:
    - Setosa
    - Versicolor
    - Virginica
