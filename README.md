# Task 1: Iris Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is commonly used for machine learning classification tasks.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species label for each sample.

### Features
1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

### Target Variable
- Species:
    - Setosa
    - Versicolor
    - Virginica

# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview
Predicting car prices is a significant domain within machine learning research, as numerous factors contribute to a car's price, including brand reputation, features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more. This project aims to train a machine learning model to predict car prices based on these factors.

## Project Scope
The project involves the following key components:
- Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset containing information about various car features and their corresponding prices.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features and transforming the data to improve model performance.
- Model Training: Selecting and training appropriate machine learning algorithms to predict car prices.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained models using suitable metrics to assess their performance and accuracy.
- Deployment: Deploying the best-performing model for real-world usage, allowing users to input car features and receive price predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various car features and their corresponding prices. Features may include brand reputation, car specifications, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have installed all the dependencies.
2. Open and run the `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

# Task 3: Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, and fare. The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers' demographics and whether they survived or not.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains the following features:

### Features
1. PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
2. Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0)
3. Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
4. Name: Passenger's name
5. Sex: Passenger's sex
6. Age: Passenger's age
7. SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
8. Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
9. Ticket: Ticket number
10. Fare: Fare paid for the ticket
11. Cabin: Cabin number
12. Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

## Usage
